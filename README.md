- ⚡ Fun fact: ...The First "Computer Bug"
While we use the term "bug" to describe coding errors today, the term was cemented in history by a literal insect.
The Event: In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team were working on the Harvard Mark II computer. The system suddenly failed.
The Discovery: Upon investigating the hardware, they found a moth trapped between the contact points of Relay #70.
The Legacy: They taped the dead moth into the lab logbook with the caption: "First actual case of bug being found."
That very logbook (with the moth still taped to it!) is preserved at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
